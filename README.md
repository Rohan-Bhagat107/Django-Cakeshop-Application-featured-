# Django-Cakeshop-Application-featured-
I have build a cakeshop application using Django framework which has features like sign up, login, view cakes, View details, Categorywise cake filtering, Add to cart, order cart item and maintaining order history etc
<br>
Steps to run this application-> <br> 1) python manage.py runserver <br> 2) register(New user)/Login( Existing user) <br> 3) view cakes on the opened page(home page) 4) Filter cakes based on categories(Birthday, Anniversary etc) <br> 5) Vies deatils of cake required <br> 6) Add it to cart if needed <br> 7) order it from the cart by making payment.
<br>
<b>NOTE</b>: This application doesn't connect you to the realtime payment gatway. The payment functionality is only for the testing purpose.
